/**
 * Polymorphism in Java allows us to write the code that can call a method, but the actual method that gets executed can be different for different objects at runtime.
 *
 * This means that behavior that occurs during program execution depends on the runtime type of the object, which might differ from its declared type in the code.
 *
 * For polymorphism to work, the declared type must have a relationship with the runtime type. Inheritance is one way to establish this relationship, where subclasses can override a method from its superclass, enabling polymorphic behavior.
